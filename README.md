# NTT-Accelerator
An NTT Accelerator implementation based on ongoing research.

# 1. Introduction
This project aims to implement an efficient hardware accelerator for polynomial multiplication using the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) on FPGA. The NTT is crucial in cryptographic applications like Kyber, a finalist in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, due to its potential resistance against quantum attacks. However, executing NTT efficiently poses challenges such as high memory requirements and complex memory access patterns. This research proposes an optimized NTT architecture tailored for FPGA implementation to enhance computation speed. The project focuses on developing and integrating several strategies for efficiency improvement, addressing diverse performance requirements across various applications. By leveraging FPGAâ€™s parallel processing capabilities and customizable hardware design, the goal is to achieve significant acceleration in polynomial multiplication operations compared to traditional software-based approaches. This project is based on recent literature which propose optimized and effective hardware implementations of the NTT algorithm on FPGA yielding highly desirable results.

# 2. Objectives
Implement and test a hardware accelerator to effectively perform the Number Theoretic Transform on FPGA. We
will focus on optimizing the implementation further by incooperating recent research.

# 3. Methodology
The implementation will be based on the paper [BAM24] which describes the implementation of an optimized NTT
algorithm on an FPGA. Testing will be done using the implementation on FPGA and the results will be analyzed.

# 3.1 NTT Algorithm
The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a generalization of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) over finite fields. The NTT is used in polynomial multiplication and is crucial in cryptographic applications like Kyber, a finalist in the NIST post-quantum cryptography standardization process, due to its potential resistance against quantum attacks. The NTT algorithm is defined as follows: 

Terms:
- $p$ is a prime number.
- $n$ is a power of 2.
- $\omega$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity modulo $p$.
- $a = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ is a sequence of $n$ elements. When $a$ is a polynomial, $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.
- $A = (A_0, A_1, \ldots, A_{n-1})$ is the NTT of $a$.

Forward NTT:
$$A_k = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j \cdot \omega^{jk} \mod p$$

Inverse NTT:
$$a_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A_j \cdot \omega^{-jk} \mod p$$

# 3.2 Pointwise Multiplication
Pointwise multiplication is a fundamental operation in many applications, including error correction, signal processing, and cryptography. Given two sequences $a = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1})$ and $b = (b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{n-1})$, the pointwise product $c = (c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{n-1})$ is defined as follows:

$$c_k = a_k \cdot b_k \mod p$$

To efficiently compute the point-wise multiplication we can use the Karatsuba algorithm. This can be achieved by reconfiguring the Butterfly units.

# 3.3 Polynomial Multiplication
Polynomial multiplication is a fundamental operation in many applications, including error correction, signal processing, and cryptography. The NTT can be used to accelerate polynomial multiplication. Given two polynomials $a(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \ldots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ and $b(x) = b_0 + b_1x + \ldots + b_{n-1}x^{n-1}$, the product $c(x) = a(x) \cdot b(x)$ can be computed using the NTT as follows:

1. Compute the NTT of $a$ and $b$: $A = \text{NTT}(a)$ and $B = \text{NTT}(b)$.
2. Compute the pointwise product of $A$ and $B$: $C = (A_0 \cdot B_0, A_1 \cdot B_1, \ldots, A_{n-1} \cdot B_{n-1})$.
3. Compute the inverse NTT of $C$: $c = \text{INTT}(C)$.

# 4. Implementation
The implementation will be done using the VHDL code and the Vivado Design Suite. The RTL will then be synthesized to a bitstream using Vivado Design Suite. The bitstream will then be tested on an FPGA. The FPGA used will be the Nexys A7 Board. The results will be analyzed and compared with the results in the paper.

# 4.1 Hardware Architecture
Based on the paper [BAM24], the hardware architecture will be implemented. The architecture consists of the following components:
1. Reconfigurable Butterfly Unit including optimized modular reduction.
2. A 2x2 Butterfly Core
3. A NTT RAM to read and write coefficients
4. A twiddle factor ROM to store precomputed twiddle factors

The architecture is shown in the following diagram:
